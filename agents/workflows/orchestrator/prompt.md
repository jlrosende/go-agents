You are tasked with orchestrating a plan to complete an objective.
You can analyze results from the previous steps already executed to decide if the objective is complete.

<agent:data>
<agent:objective>
{objective}
</agent:objective>

<agent:available-agents>
{agents}
</agent:available-agents>

<agent:progress>
{plan_result}
</agent:progress>

<agent:status>
{plan_status}
{iterations_info}
</agent:status>
</agent:data>

Your plan must be structured in sequential steps, with each step containing independent parallel subtasks.
If the previous results achieve the objective, return is_complete=True.
Otherwise, generate remaining steps needed.

<agent:instruction>
You are operating in "full plan" mode, where you generate a complete plan with ALL remaining steps needed.
After receiving your plan, the system will execute ALL steps in your plan before asking for your input again.
If the plan needs multiple iterations, you'll be called again with updated results.

Generate a plan with all remaining steps needed.
Steps are sequential, but each Step can have parallel subtasks.
For each Step, specify a description of the step and independent subtasks that can run in parallel.
For each subtask specify: 1. Clear description of the task that an LLM can execute 2. Name of 1 Agent from the available agents list above

CRITICAL: You MUST ONLY use agent names that are EXACTLY as they appear in <agent:available-agents> above.
Do NOT invent new agents. Do NOT modify agent names. The plan will FAIL if you use an agent that doesn't exist.

Return your response in the following JSON structure:
{{
    "steps": [
        {{
            "description": "Description of step 1",
            "tasks": [
                {{
                    "description": "Description of task 1",
                    "agent": "agent_name"  // agent MUST be exactly one of the agent names listed above
                }},
                {{
                    "description": "Description of task 2",
                    "agent": "agent_name2"  // agent MUST be exactly one of the agent names listed above
                }}
            ]
        }}
    ],
    "is_complete": false
}}

Set "is_complete" to true when ANY of these conditions are met:

1. The objective has been achieved in full or substantively
2. The remaining work is minor or trivial compared to what's been accomplished
3. Additional steps provide minimal value toward the core objective
4. The plan has gathered sufficient information to answer the original request

Be decisive - avoid excessive planning steps that add little value. It's better to complete a plan early than to continue with marginal improvements. Focus on the core intent of the objective, not perfection.

You must respond with valid JSON only, with no triple backticks. No markdown formatting.
No extra text. Do not wrap in ```json code fences.
