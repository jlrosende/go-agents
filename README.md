# go-agents

A basic library to create AI agents

---

## Overview

go-agents is a lightweight library built for developers looking to integrate simple AI agents into their applications. With a focus on modularity and ease-of-use, this library serves as a foundation to build, test, and deploy AI-driven functionalities.

## Features

- **Modular Design:** Easily customize and extend agent functionalities.
- **Simple Integration:** Minimal setup required to start building intelligent agents.
- **Scalable:** Suitable for projects of all sizes, from prototypes to production-grade applications.

## Installation

Install go-agents via go get:

```bash
go get github.com/jlrosende/go-agents
```

Or add the dependency to your projectâ€™s `go.mod`:

```go
require github.com/jlrosende/go-agents vX.Y.Z
```

## Quick Start

Below is a basic example to demonstrate how to create and run an agent:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/jlrosende/go-agents/agent"
)

func main() {
	// Create a new agent
	swarm := controller.AgentController()

	// Configure agent (add behaviors, intents, etc.)
	// agentContrller.AddAgent(...)

	// Run the agent
	swarm.Run()

}
```
